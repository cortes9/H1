A programming language is a way for humans to communicate with computers.
It allows programmers to write instructions that tell a computer what tasks
to perform. These tasks can include solving problems, storing data, or
interacting with users. Without programming languages, computers would not
be able to run applications or perform useful work.

<p>
Programming languages use specific rules called syntax. If the syntax is
incorrect, the program will not run properly. Learning a programming language
helps people understand how computers think and how software is built.
